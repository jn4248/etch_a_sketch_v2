/////////////    FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES - IMPORTANT  /////////////////////////

= add optional 10% alpha-grading: (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
= mouse skips if moves too fast ???
= new button to show instructions as a hidden drop down screen?  might have trouble with z-index...how can I bring to front so doesn't squish rest of info (don't want to make everything relative/absolute like i did for the set-default-color menu).  If I do this, I could make the top section smaller, and maybe fit all on the screen better)
= wrap entire javascript as a function() or namespace (look it up) to 'protect' against global variables.  IF I do this, do I still use (document).ready()....at top?
= cursor will highlight text if you mouse-click and hold to draw, and then accidentally go out of the drawing grid and over text.  it is a common fix to find.
= could create tile Objects, and have set methods to change the states of the ojbects?  might be able to use numbers instead of strings for data, and not have to concatenate to form 'rgba(0,0,0,1.0)' etc...but might have to keep track of the objcets? not sure if it's any better...other than for encapsulation and security.

///////////  VISUAL / BEUTIFICATION   /////////////////////////////////////
= button size changes when clicked (erase and alpha), because no fixed dimensions, and text is changing. ('on' to 'off'). looks bad because ALL buttons are moving on the control panel. check code I used for top navigation bar on my first google page (i got code from internet...)
